# Cursor IDE Rules for Credit Intelligence API

## Health Endpoints Implementation

The application now includes comprehensive health and monitoring endpoints:

### Endpoints Added:
- GET /healthz → Basic liveness check (process up)
- GET /readyz → Comprehensive readiness check (DB, OpenAI API, S3)
- GET /info → Application version, git SHA, build time
- GET /metrics → Prometheus-formatted metrics

### Implementation Details:
- Health service (`app/services/health_service.py`) handles all health checks
- Health router (`app/api/health_router.py`) provides FastAPI endpoints
- Prometheus metrics integration for observability
- Kubernetes-ready liveness and readiness probes
- Comprehensive dependency checking (PostgreSQL, OpenAI, AWS S3)
- System resource monitoring (CPU, memory, disk)

### Dependencies Added:
- prometheus_client==0.19.0
- psutil==5.9.6

### Documentation:
- README.md updated with complete health endpoint documentation
- Kubernetes deployment examples included
- Monitoring and observability section added

### Files Modified/Created:
- requirements.txt - Added prometheus and psutil dependencies
- app/main.py - Integrated health router
- app/services/health_service.py - Core health checking logic
- app/api/health_router.py - FastAPI health endpoints with Prometheus metrics
- README.md - Comprehensive documentation update
